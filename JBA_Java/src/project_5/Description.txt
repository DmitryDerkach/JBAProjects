Project: Cinema Room Manager

About:
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and
live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. 
In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available
seats, see sales statistics, and more.

Learning outcomes:
This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Java. You will deal with multi-dimensional 
arrays and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.

Program reads two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row. 
These numbers represent the coordinates of the seat according to which the program calculates the ticket price. 
The ticket price is:
•	If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
•	In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. 
Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, 
and the second half is the last 5 rows.
